# How it works

DermaAI is a mobile app that helps you learn about common skin problems.  
It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze skin images and give helpful guidance.

1. Take or upload a photo of your skin.  
2. The app checks for patterns using AI.  
3. It gives you possible results and advice.  
4. You also get easy-to-read information pages like this one.  

⚠️ Note: DermaAI is for **education only**.  
For serious or worrying skin issues, always see a doctor.
