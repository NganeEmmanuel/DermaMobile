# How is it diagnosed?

Doctors usually look at your skin to know if you have acne, eczema, or another condition.  
No special tests are needed most of the time.

- They may ask about your daily habits.  
- They may check if anyone in your family has skin problems.  
- Sometimes, a small skin sample is tested in a lab (rare).
