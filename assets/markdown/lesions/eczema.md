# Eczema

Eczema is a condition that makes the skin dry, itchy, and sometimes red or cracked.  
It often comes and goes in “flare-ups.”

## Why it happens
- Sensitive skin that reacts to triggers like soap, dust, or certain foods.  
- Stress and weather changes can make it worse.

## What you can do
- Use gentle, fragrance-free moisturizers.  
- Avoid scratching to prevent infection.  
- Take short baths with lukewarm water.  
- Doctors may give creams to reduce itching and swelling.
